Usage
--------------

> It is not necessary to install any package or even LaTeX in your personal computer because the online system like *overleaf* supports all that you want.

Open [*overleaf.com*](https://www.overleaf.com/) in your Chrome.

Our Examples
--------------

### Bayesian Networks

- Open [BCPF.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BCPF.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:

  > BCPF (Bayesian CP factorization) model as a Bayesian network and a directed factor graph.

- Open [BGCP.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BGCP.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following pictures:

  > BGCP (Bayesian Gaussian CP decomposition) model as a Bayesian network and a directed factor graph.

- Open [BGCP-1.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BGCP-1.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:

  > Another example for BGCP (Bayesian Gaussian CP decomposition) model as a Bayesian network and a directed factor graph.

- Open [BATF.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BATF.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:

![BATF](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BATF.png)

  > BATF (Bayesian augmented tensor factorization) model as a Bayesian network and a directed factor graph.

### Research Frameworks

- Open
  - [tc_framework.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/Framework/tc_framework.tex)
- Upload

  > Tensor completion task and its framework including data organization and tensor completion, in which traffic measurements are partially observed.

### Tensor Factorization

- Open [AuTF.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/TensorFactorization/AuTF.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:
