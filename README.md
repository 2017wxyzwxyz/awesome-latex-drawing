Usage
--------------

> It is not necessary to install any package or even LaTeX in your personal computer because the online system like *overleaf* supports all that you want.

Open [*overleaf.com*](https://www.overleaf.com/) in your Chrome.

Our Examples
--------------

### Bayesian Networks

- Open [BCPF.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/BayesNet/BCPF.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:

  > BCPF (Bayesian CP factorization) model as a Bayesian network and a directed factor graph.

### Research Frameworks

- Open
  - [tc_framework.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/Framework/tc_framework.tex)
- Upload
  - [curve1.pdf](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/Framework/curve1.pdf)
  - [curve2.pdf](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/Framework/curve2.pdf)

in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:

  > Tensor completion task and its framework including data organization and tensor completion, in which traffic measurements are partially observed.

### Tensor Factorization

- Open [AuTF.tex](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing/blob/master/TensorFactorization/AuTF.tex) in your overleaf project, you will see the following picture:
